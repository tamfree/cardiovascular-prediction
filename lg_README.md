## Project Overview
In this project, we aim to predict the likelihood of a person developing heart disease using various health-related features. We’ll use different machine learning models, train them on the dataset, and optimize them to get the best possible results. The dataset is cleaned, preprocessed, and used to train models, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

## Dataset Information
- **Target Variable**: `Heart Disease`
  - 1: Heart Disease
  - 0: No Heart Disease
- **Features**:
  - Continuous variables: Age, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol Level, BMI, etc.
  - Categorical variables: Gender, Smoking Status, Alcohol Consumption, etc.

---

## Data Preprocessing
The dataset goes through a thorough cleaning process to ensure accurate predictions. These steps include:
1. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - Numerical features have missing values filled with their median values.
   - Categorical features use the mode (most common value) to fill missing entries.
2. **Feature Scaling**:
   - StandardScaler is applied to scale the features for better model performance.
3. **Dimensionality Reduction**:
   - PCA is used to reduce the number of features while retaining most of the variance, which helps models perform faster and more effectively.

## Visualization
Several key visualizations help us understand the relationships in the data:
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Displays how different features are related.

- **Target Variable Distribution**: Shows how many people in the dataset have heart disease vs. those who don't.
- **Model Evaluation Plots**: Includes ROC curves, Precision-Recall curves, and learning curves to assess model performance.

## Model Implementation
We implement and compare the following models:
1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Random Forest**
3. **Gradient Boosting**
4. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

For each model, we:
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Train the model on the training data and evaluate it using the test data.
- Measure performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.

---

## Model Optimization
To improve model performance:
- **Hyperparameter tuning** is done using GridSearchCV, which helps find the best settings for each model.
- **Class balancing** techniques are used to address imbalances in the dataset, as heart disease cases may be fewer than non-cases.
- The models are fine-tuned through iterative changes, and the performance is documented in a CSV file for transparency.

## Analysis and Conclusion
### Key Findings:
- **Best Performing Model**: Gradient Boosting achieved the best results in terms of accuracy and ROC AUC.
- **Class Imbalance**: SVM showed lower precision when recall was increased, likely due to an imbalanced dataset.
- **Important Features**: Features like Triglyceride Levels, Cholesterol Levels, and Smoking were found to be significant predictors for heart disease.

### Recommendations:
1. Address **class imbalance** using techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or adjusting class weights.
2. Explore additional models or **ensemble methods** to combine multiple models and improve results.
3. Experiment with **feature engineering** and data augmentation to increase the dataset's quality.

## Final Notes
This project shows a complete machine learning pipeline: from data cleaning to model optimization and evaluation. The findings help in understanding how different health factors contribute to the likelihood of heart disease and suggest ways to improve the model's predictions.
